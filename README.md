# Shootings_in_USA

## Data 
The data has been collected from the Washington Post. It is available in this repository - https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings. 


## Objectives
The analysis will focus on examining racial and ethnic disparities, regional variations, and situational factors. The study aims to uncover any potential biases and systemic issues in the application of lethal force by police. It also looks into extreme cases such as underage/unarmed shootings that did not pose any threat.

The insights derived from this analysis could inform future policy changes, training programs, and law enforcement strategies to minimize the occurrence of fatal encounters and promote more equitable policing practices.
